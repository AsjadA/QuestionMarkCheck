# QuestionMarkCheck
The program takes a string parameter which will contain single digit numbers, letters and question marks.
It will check if there are exactly 3 question marks between a pair of numbers. If its True then the string should be returned, else it should return False.
If there arent any 2 numbers that add upto 10 in the string in the string, then it reurns False.
